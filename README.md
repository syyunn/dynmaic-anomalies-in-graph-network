Lits about anomalies detection in dynamic graph network

## Notion
Since I can't figure out what is important in this huge lobby network, I'd like to let algorithm to find what something unusual happens. This is the main reason I am getting here. 

## Anomalies
sudden (dis)appearance of large dense directed graph

Graph Level Anomaly Detection http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/project/26424135.pdf
- one step edge completion problems for graph representation learning
- The goal is that in learning to predict masked out graph features on a particular graph class, when presented an anomalous class our model will flag anomalous structures as unlikely "completions" based on the normal distribution.
